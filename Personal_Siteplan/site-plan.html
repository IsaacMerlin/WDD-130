      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose of this website is to document events throughout my life, others may be able to use this to their benefit by finding something relatable. Possible contact of me may be added at one point. This could be able to help people, or bring people together. To show them a new perspective on life, to bring people who dont know eachother together. This can be used to bring people back to their roots and feel a better connection with themselves and others. This can be used to help people who are sick and struggling with life to find peace. The purpose of this website is infinite in helping other people. It can be used for so much good and can change the outcome of someones life possibly. That is what is so great about bringing the purpose of the website to my attention. Documenting my life will allow me to be reminded of things that I do in the past and what happens in my life over time. That can be very interesting to look back on over a period of time.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience would probably be someone interested in computer science, technology, music or any of the other hobbies I am into! My audience can be for the weak or strong of hear. It can be for people who are young or people who are old. It can be for my family or for people who I do not know yet or may never know. It can be for people who are from the united states or people from anywhere else in the world. It can be for peopele who want to bring their perspective to my website or people who just want to see what I am doing. It can be for people who need help figuring out something or for people who need to be entertained. This webstie is for anyone and everyone, that is what is soo cool about this website. It has no true audience, the audience is the people who find their way to my webstie. People will be amazed when they find my website because of the hard work that I put into it and the uniqueness of it. That is why my audience can be anyone who is young or old, or from anywhere in the world, this is why it can be for anyone who needs help learning something or help being related to.</p>  <!-- change this -->
