    <h1>This is the about me page.</h1>
    <a id="aboutme">About me, there is so much to say. I am from Moscow Idaho, born and raised and moved to Rexburg Idaho when I turned 20. This is a great place to stay and I really enjoy it here. I spend most of my time working construction doing framing, but like to spend my free time as DJ Nuance, and hanging out with my friends. I like to go hot tubbing and ride my motorcycle around aswell when I have free time. I am a computer science major and I really enjoy the time I spend here with my friends. I hope to use this website to be able to express myself and take notes of what I am doing/ keep an updated track of things through this website. It is a great way to organize thoughts and ideas in a easy, and organizable manner. This next fall semester I want to become better and Python and HTML.</a>
