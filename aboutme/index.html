    <p><b>Hello!</b> I hope everyone is having a great day! I plan on having the best day ever. I am going to BYU-I for computer science and plan on getting a job in the computer financial industry or developing new computers that are smarter than the ones we have. I love to work with wood and build things in my free time and I also love music, automobiles, and money. I am not married, have no children or grandchildren, and have 3 younger brothers. I currently have a job building commercial houses and apartments. We are currently working on in rigby but will soon be working on the new sundance apartments behind the cove in rexburg. Honk if you're passing! I am persuing a BS here at BYU-I and I love the school enviornment the most here. I have been a member of the LDS Church since I was 8. I do not have a favorite scriptuere or quote as I enjoy them all equally. Best of luck to everyone this semester!</p>
